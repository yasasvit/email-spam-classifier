# Email Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression

This project aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using the Logistic Regression algorithm. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and building a predictive system. The project uses Python programming language and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and more.

## Predictive System

The project includes a predictive system where you can input an email text, and the trained model will predict whether it's spam or ham. To use the predictive system, follow these steps:

## Results

The effectiveness of the email spam detection model is demonstrated through its accuracy to classify emails as spam or non-span on both the training and testing data:

- Accuracy on Training Data: Approximately 96.86%
- Accuracy on Testing Data: About 95.07%
